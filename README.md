- 👋 Hi, I’m @Finnerjs
- 👀 I’m interested in Graphic Design, Front End Development and how Artificial Intelligence will change the way we code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects at my level.
- 📫 How to reach me other than through Github is the real question ;)
